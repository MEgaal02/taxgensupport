TaxGenSupport

TaxGen is a web app designed to bring people together to talk, discuss, and share their experiences with taxes under HMRC in the UK. During my time working as a tax advisor at HMRC, I noticed how many people struggled to understand tax rules and processes, often feeling confused and overwhelmed. This inspired me to create a platform where people can support each other, ask questions, and exchange knowledge, helping reduce stress and mistakes around taxes.

I chose Django for this project because it offers a modernized, full-control approach to building web applications. It allows me to manage everything from routing and templates to database models in a clean and scalable way. One example of this is how I implemented a custom abstract user model, which gives more flexibility for user account editing and ensures the application can scale easily as the community grows.

The app’s tech stack includes Django (Python) for the backend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and SQLite for development. Django’s built-in features like authentication, ORM, and templating made it possible to quickly build a robust, full-stack web application while keeping the code maintainable and scalable. 

TaxGenSupport is ultimately about bridging the knowledge gap in taxation and providing a space where users can share experiences and help each other navigate UK tax matters more confidently.
